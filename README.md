 ### **About**
Aiming to diverse protein sequence attributes, establishing a simple protein sequence attribute management system, which is convenient for staff to browse, and able to download the attributes of related protein sequences, assisting the staff in statistical analysis of the included protein sequence information.

<br />

### **Implementation**
The program contains two modules, interactive module and database operation module. The interactive module is used to parse the instructions input by the user, and pass the parsing result to the database operation module; the database operation module is used to manage the sequence in the database, which can operate the recorded sequence information according to the analysis result of the interactive module, and transfer the corresponding sequence information. The result of the operation is passed to the interaction module.

<br />

### **Operating environment**
